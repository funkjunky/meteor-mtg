Meteor todo:
---
//finish Thursday
 - make pretty and useable with css and such.... ready for release
////////
 - make sure the deck builder is good enough to at least make a deck from a draft without the experience sucking hard.
 - export to .dec or whatever it is for playing
 - add theros set as an option, and allow the option to choose for draft and sealed.
 - release!
 - for non-draft and sealed decks, there should be an infinite pool. [keep in mind later, there will likely be an EDH resitrction as well, where they can add any ONE card]
 - address any performance issues that may exist. As well as any recent feedback.
 - consider using "yeilds" form iron router, instead of partials from handlebars
 - clean up code.
 - fix deck builder... not sure how...
 - I need to use requireJS or something... the order of JS being loaded is a problem and the global variables everywhere is very bad...

*future*
	- consider, having the pool be a reference, so we can reuse "standard", etc.
