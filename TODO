Meteor todo:
---
//finish Thursday
 - Make pretty
	- drafter
		- just make the image clickable [no siding or any features.]
			-sort cards by color, then rarity, then cost
		- **think of nice design!!**
	- deck builder
		- **think of nice design!!**
	- add better spacing between sections on homepage.
	- fix chat room spacing
	- add borders were necessary, like draft lobby
	- do draft lobby header better... try and figure out how to get the data into the :after header peice.
	- homepage extras
		- active drafts should be hidden, but if one exists, then show the section in red as a warning, so they know they need to get back in it asap.
	- ensure ipad support. Could maybe use xcode/ios simulator to test?
	- make sure if i highlight a box, then the entire box is clickable, like choosing drafts in lobby, and it being highliighed yellow, but its an a tag only.
////////
 - if a draft has no players, because the last player left, then remove it.
 - if a draft has been in lobby for longer than an hour, then remove it. [who was trigger this???]
 - make sure the deck builder is good enough to at least make a deck from a draft without the experience sucking hard.
 - export to .dec or whatever it is for playing
 - add theros set as an option, and allow the option to choose for draft and sealed.
 - release!
 - for non-draft and sealed decks, there should be an infinite pool. [keep in mind later, there will likely be an EDH resitrction as well, where they can add any ONE card]
 - address any performance issues that may exist. As well as any recent feedback.
 - event assignments should be in the onAfterRun of the router, so we don't add all events no matter the route.
 - better security
 - consider using "yeilds" form iron router, instead of partials from handlebars
 - clean up code.
 - fix deck builder... not sure how...
 - I need to use requireJS or something... the order of JS being loaded is a problem and the global variables everywhere is very bad...

*future*
	- consider, having the pool be a reference, so we can reuse "standard", etc.
