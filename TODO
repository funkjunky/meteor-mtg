Meteor todo:
---
 - add drafting page
		- going to the page should start the draft, if one isn't already started
			- call the method on click in the draftcard event
				- on return refresh the cards the user has
			- round off the corners for the draft with bots
 - add a textual pool
 - use iron router to handle all the routing for our app. Using yeilds and such.
 - I need to use requireJS or something... the order of JS being loaded is a problem and the global variables everywhere is very bad...
 - show foils as foils

*future*
	- consider, having the pool be a reference, so we can reuse "standard", etc.
