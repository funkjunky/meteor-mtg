Meteor todo:
---

 - back button doesnt leave lobby...
 - double check live site feedback... if there is anything knew maybe note it... otherwise try and clear it? hmm.....
 - Release! But still don't mention the drafter.
	- post comment on my facebook post, mention all t he things I've fixed. Reference redmine.
 - switch from cardimage to text in builder
 - in draft summary, when a card is highlight, highlight all cards from that pack! This could be a super neat feature.
 - release again specifying what was updated on FB
 - address the atrocious code I've created...
	- fix vim indenting it's bad... for both html and js
	 - add stdlib function from underscore???? I need better code! @.@
			- use in cases of dealing with lists, like colour sorting and such
	 - I need to use requireJS or something... the order of JS being loaded is a problem and the global variables everywhere is very bad...
		-remove all the things in global.js
		- try and ensure we dont use anymore global variables, collections could potentially be the exception.
	 - consider using "yeilds" form iron router, instead of partials from handlebars
 - Make the builder much more convinient somehow.
	- maybe have a visual layout of the cards, and the location of each card is saved?
 - unique chat room per drafts
 - event assignments should be in the onAfterRun of the router, so we don't add all events no matter the route.
 - setting the route session variable should be done in m-m.js, instead of every route.
 - address any performance issues that may exist. As well as any recent feedback.
 - better security

 - Get drafter on heroku
	 - for non-draft and sealed decks, there should be an infinite pool. [keep in mind later, there will likely be an EDH resitrction as well, where they can add any ONE card]
	 - Try doing a blank meteor project with some sample data and deploying to heroku. If it doesn't work, then ask on SO about it and post the issue on the github.

*future*
	- consider, having the pool be a reference, so we can reuse "standard", etc.
