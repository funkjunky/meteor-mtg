Meteor todo:
---
 - add drafting page
		- add another page for darfting and use that as the default.
		- going to the page should start the draft, if one isn't already started
			- setup everything to start the draft, in the collections
				-new pack documents, with owners and draftid, and user to pass to
				-new draft document, with users/owners in order, status [inprogress or done]
			- add the meteor method for taking a card and passing a pack
			- call the method on click in the draftcard event
				- on return refresh the cards the user has
			- round off the corners for the draft with bots
 - add a textual pool
 - use iron router to handle all the routing for our app. Using yeilds and such.
 - I need to use requireJS or something... the order of JS being loaded is a problem and the global variables everywhere is very bad...

*future*
	- consider, having the pool be a reference, so we can reuse "standard", etc.
