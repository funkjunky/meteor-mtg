Meteor todo:
---
 - switch from cardimage to text in builder
 - use vertical button group for buttons on builder cards
 - fix colour selection, so the buttons are simple and nice looking, perhaps drop the letter, and simply use the colour as an indicator to save room?
*get here befor ei lieave timmies*
 - add a clone button on the /deck/owner/name page. It will make the exact same named deck under the current user... but if it already exists, then increment count as usual... I should probably put that thing in a function or something... perhaps a deny on inserting.
 - for multicolored cards, make sure their class isn't "red white" it's "redwhite"... this way it will neither be turned on or off by the filter.
 - hovering over image in draft should create the pointer cursor
 - back button doesnt leave lobby...
 - Release! But still don't mention the drafter.
	- post comment on my facebook post, mention all t he things I've fixed. Reference redmine.
 - in draft summary, when a card is highlight, highlight all cards from that pack! This could be a super neat feature.
 - release again specifying what was updated on FB
 - address the atrocious code I've created...
	 - add stdlib function from underscore???? I need better code! @.@
			- use in cases of dealing with lists, like colour sorting and such
	 - I need to use requireJS or something... the order of JS being loaded is a problem and the global variables everywhere is very bad...
		-remove all the things in global.js
		- try and ensure we dont use anymore global variables, collections could potentially be the exception.
	 - consider using "yeilds" form iron router, instead of partials from handlebars
 - Make the builder much more convinient somehow.
	- maybe have a visual layout of the cards, and the location of each card is saved?
 - unique chat room per drafts
 - event assignments should be in the onAfterRun of the router, so we don't add all events no matter the route.
 - setting the route session variable should be done in m-m.js, instead of every route.
 - address any performance issues that may exist. As well as any recent feedback.
 - better security

 - Get drafter on heroku
	 - for non-draft and sealed decks, there should be an infinite pool. [keep in mind later, there will likely be an EDH resitrction as well, where they can add any ONE card]
	 - Try doing a blank meteor project with some sample data and deploying to heroku. If it doesn't work, then ask on SO about it and post the issue on the github.

*future*
	- consider, having the pool be a reference, so we can reuse "standard", etc.
