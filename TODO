Meteor todo:
---
 - start up a bug report thing somewhere!!
	- add the bug that the sideboard card appears to not be sided crorectly during a draft.
	- transition after finishing a draft isn't working.
	- add google analytics
 - remove all console.logs
 - Try doing a blank meteor project with some sample data and deploying to heroku. If it doesn't work, then ask on SO about it and post the issue on the github.
 - release! Tomorrow. Then test the release again. Then post about it on FB and everywhere.
 - add a button to draft pool cards to hide them as a button below the other cards. or some way to hide cards.
 - add in the ability to see the other draft players decks
 - back button doesnt leave lobby... i should make a bug list =P
 - unique chat room per drafts
 - do draft lobby header better... try and figure out how to get the data into the :after header peice.
 - the filters won't work on multicoloured cards... change it so the card has the class of every colour identity it has. hmmm or not... think of a better way. maybe an attribute that marks it as multicolor. i dunno... this is tricky...
 - make the builder cards much more convinient to use.
 - hovering over image in draft should create the pointer cursor
 - for non-draft and sealed decks, there should be an infinite pool. [keep in mind later, there will likely be an EDH resitrction as well, where they can add any ONE card]
 - address the atrocious code I've created...
 - address any performance issues that may exist. As well as any recent feedback.
 - event assignments should be in the onAfterRun of the router, so we don't add all events no matter the route.
 - setting the route session variable should be done in m-m.js, instead of every route.
 - better security
 - consider using "yeilds" form iron router, instead of partials from handlebars
 - clean up code.
 - fix deck builder... not sure how...
 - I need to use requireJS or something... the order of JS being loaded is a problem and the global variables everywhere is very bad...

*future*
	- consider, having the pool be a reference, so we can reuse "standard", etc.
